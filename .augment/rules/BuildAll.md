Build the complete QtForge project from scratch and systematically fix all compilation errors, linking issues, and build failures that are encountered during the process. This should include:

1. First, analyze the project structure and identify the build system being used (CMake, qmake, etc.)
2. Check for and install any missing dependencies or prerequisites
3. Attempt to build the project using the appropriate build commands
4. For each error encountered:
   - Identify the root cause of the issue
   - Implement the necessary fixes (missing includes, incorrect paths, API changes, etc.)
   - Verify the fix resolves the specific error
5. Continue iterating through the build process until the project compiles successfully
6. Ensure all components of the project build without warnings or errors
7. Verify that the build produces the expected output files/executables

Document each issue found and the solution applied. If any errors cannot be resolved due to missing information or external dependencies, clearly identify what additional resources would be needed.
