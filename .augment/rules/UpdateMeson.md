Update the Meson build system to match the latest implementation and ensure it has equivalent functionality to the CMake build system. Specifically:

1. Analyze the current CMake build configuration to identify all features, dependencies, targets, and build options
2. Compare the existing Meson build files with the CMake configuration to identify discrepancies
3. Update the Meson build files (meson.build) to include:
   - All the same library dependencies and their versions
   - Equivalent compiler flags and build options
   - The same executable and library targets
   - Matching installation rules and paths
   - Equivalent conditional compilation flags
   - Same testing framework integration if present
4. Ensure both build systems produce identical build artifacts and have the same build behavior
5. Verify that all build variants (debug, release, etc.) work consistently between both systems
6. Test the updated Meson configuration to confirm it builds successfully and produces the expected outputs

The goal is to maintain feature parity between the two build systems so developers can use either CMake or Meson interchangeably for building the project.
