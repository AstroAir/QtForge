## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Bindings not available"**
   ```
   ‚ùå QtForge bindings not available
   ```
   **Solution:** Rebuild QtForge with bindings enabled

2. **"Poor performance"**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Slow object creation performance
   ```
   **Solution:** Check build configuration, use release builds for performance testing

3. **"Memory leaks detected"**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Potential memory leak: 1024 KB
   ```
   **Solution:** This may be expected in development environments; verify in production

4. **"Thread safety issues"**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Thread safety issues detected
   ```
   **Solution:** Check for race conditions and proper synchronization

### Debugging Performance Issues

1. **Profile Individual Operations:**
   ```python
   # Python profiling
   import cProfile
   cProfile.run('your_code_here()')
   ```

2. **Monitor Memory Usage:**
   ```python
   # Python memory monitoring
   import tracemalloc
   tracemalloc.start()
   # ... your code ...
   current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
   ```

3. **Lua Memory Monitoring:**
   ```lua
   -- Lua memory monitoring
   local before = collectgarbage("count")
   -- ... your code ...
   local after = collectgarbage("count")
   print("Memory used:", after - before, "KB")
   ```

## Optimization Recommendations

### Python Optimizations

1. **Use object pooling** for frequently created/destroyed objects
2. **Implement weak references** for observer patterns
3. **Call gc.collect()** strategically in long-running applications
4. **Use __slots__** for memory-efficient classes
5. **Profile with cProfile** and memory_profiler

### Lua Optimizations

1. **Call collectgarbage()** strategically in long-running scripts
2. **Use weak tables** for caches and observer patterns
3. **Minimize table creation** in hot code paths
4. **Reuse objects** where possible
5. **Monitor memory with collectgarbage("count")**

### General Optimizations

1. **Use release builds** for performance testing
2. **Enable compiler optimizations** (-O2, -O3)
3. **Consider memory alignment** for data structures
4. **Implement lazy initialization** where appropriate
5. **Profile under realistic workloads**

## Integration with CI/CD

### Automated Performance Testing

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Performance Tests
  run: |
    cmake -DQTFORGE_BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DQTFORGE_BUILD_LUA_BINDINGS=ON ..
    make
    python tests/performance/run_performance_tests.py
```

### Performance Regression Detection

The test runner saves performance metrics to `performance_metrics.json` for trend analysis:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "python_metrics": {
    "object_creation_rate": 500,
    "method_call_rate": 2000,
    "memory_efficiency": 8192
  },
  "lua_metrics": {
    "object_creation_rate": 300,
    "method_call_rate": 1500,
    "memory_efficiency": 6144
  }
}
```
