## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

Monitoring and orchestration testing requires:
```cmake
-DQTFORGE_BUILD_MONITORING=ON
-DQTFORGE_BUILD_ORCHESTRATION=ON
-DQTFORGE_BUILD_TESTS=ON
-DQTFORGE_BUILD_PERFORMANCE_TESTS=ON
```

### Running Tests

#### All Monitoring Tests
```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R "Monitoring"
```

#### Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Hot reload tests
ctest --test-dir build -R "MonitoringHotReload"

# Metrics collection tests
ctest --test-dir build -R "MonitoringMetrics"

# Performance tests
ctest --test-dir build -R "MonitoringPerformance"

# Orchestration tests
ctest --test-dir build -R "Orchestration"
```

#### Using Test Runner
```bash
# Run all monitoring and orchestration tests
python tests/run_tests_with_timeout_handling.py --category monitoring,orchestration

# Run performance tests only
python tests/run_tests_with_timeout_handling.py --performance-only
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Monitoring Components Not Available
```
Error: QTFORGE_BUILD_MONITORING=OFF
Solution: Enable with -DQTFORGE_BUILD_MONITORING=ON
```

#### Performance Test Timeouts
```
Error: Test timeout in performance tests
Solution: Increase timeout or optimize test scenarios
```

#### File System Watcher Issues
```
Error: File system watcher setup failed
Solution: Check file permissions and system limits
```

### Debug Mode Testing
```bash
# Enable debug logging for monitoring tests
export QTFORGE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
export QTFORGE_MONITORING_DEBUG=1
ctest --test-dir build -R "Monitoring" --verbose
```
